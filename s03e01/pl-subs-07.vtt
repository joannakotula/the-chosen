00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.676
I... I don't know
what I'm writing yet

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.929
or who
I will send it to.

00:30:06.012 --> 00:30:12.477
I am certain I must document
what I am seeing.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.855
- Rabbi Yussif...

00:30:15.939 --> 00:30:18.316
I have a safe
that I use.

00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:20.235
I call it
"the cellar."

00:30:20.318 --> 00:30:26.282
It's where documents go...
to cool off.

00:30:26.366 --> 00:30:27.742
You can't imagine
how many times

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:30.036
our brothers
write something

00:30:30.119 --> 00:30:33.331
they wish they had not sent
in the morning.

00:30:33.414 --> 00:30:34.916
Other documents
remain for months.

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:37.001
It's locked
and, um...

00:30:40.588 --> 00:30:43.049
entirely
confidential.

00:30:43.132 --> 00:30:44.133
Does this sound
like a place

00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:46.469
you might want to store
your document?

00:30:50.014 --> 00:30:51.933
- I bet the goodbyes
were very hard

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:54.477
for those you've
served with, Jairus.

00:30:56.813 --> 00:30:57.814
Thank you.

00:31:04.237 --> 00:31:07.490
[door squeaks open]

00:31:12.412 --> 00:31:13.371
- It's good
to be home.

00:31:15.415 --> 00:31:16.416
[door closes shut]

00:31:17.875 --> 00:31:20.461
Even better
to be here.

00:31:24.674 --> 00:31:26.509
- Eema went back
to live with my brothers.

00:31:26.593 --> 00:31:28.845
- Yeah, I know.

00:31:28.928 --> 00:31:32.098
Most of the time, I hate
the thought of you here

00:31:32.181 --> 00:31:35.351
alone all day
and night.

00:31:35.435 --> 00:31:36.644
But in this moment...

00:31:38.146 --> 00:31:39.522
[knock on door]

00:31:42.317 --> 00:31:44.444
Shh-shh-shh-
shh-shh.

00:31:47.155 --> 00:31:50.283
[knocking continues]

00:31:54.537 --> 00:31:55.788
[door squeaks open]

00:31:56.706 --> 00:31:57.582
- Hi.

00:31:57.665 --> 00:32:00.335
- Oh, hello.

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:02.295
- What are you doing here,
Nathanael?

00:32:02.378 --> 00:32:04.464
- Simon,
you're looking at me

00:32:04.547 --> 00:32:07.258
like you wanna smash my face
with a stone.

00:32:07.342 --> 00:32:08.593
- Oh, don't be silly.

00:32:08.676 --> 00:32:09.886
Please, come.

00:32:11.387 --> 00:32:12.930
- I know, I know,
I'm sorry.

00:32:13.014 --> 00:32:14.641
I know you probably
want to be alone.

00:32:14.724 --> 00:32:17.644
But, uh,
I'm just not from here,

00:32:17.727 --> 00:32:19.020
and I heard you
might have space.

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:20.021
- Who told you that?

00:32:20.104 --> 00:32:21.314
- Of course we do,
Nathanael.

00:32:21.397 --> 00:32:23.024
- Andrew has a flat
in the east quarter.

00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:24.275
I can tell you
directions.

00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:25.234
- I thought
about that.

00:32:25.318 --> 00:32:26.194
It's just that--

00:32:26.277 --> 00:32:27.820
- Just what?

00:32:27.904 --> 00:32:29.697
- It's a one-bedroom.

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:31.783
Philip and Judas
are staying there,

00:32:31.866 --> 00:32:33.660
and they're practically
on top of each other.

00:32:34.911 --> 00:32:35.912
- It'll work out.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:41.417
- Would you be opposed
to sleeping on the roof?

00:32:41.501 --> 00:32:44.379
- I...
well, I--

00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:46.047
I heard you had
a spare room

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.507
that your mom
used to stay in, Eden.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:48.841
- Who's telling you
these things?

00:32:48.925 --> 00:32:50.301
- Have you eaten,
Nathanael?

00:32:50.385 --> 00:32:51.302
- I'm starving!

00:32:52.303 --> 00:32:53.262
- Please.

00:32:53.346 --> 00:32:54.347
Thank you.
[claps]

00:32:56.099 --> 00:32:58.768
[claps]
Oh, man.

00:32:58.851 --> 00:32:59.936
Yes.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.189
Seriously, though,
[chomps apple]

00:33:03.272 --> 00:33:05.733
don't even mind me.

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:07.110
Act like
I'm not even here.

00:33:07.193 --> 00:33:09.112
[loudly chomping]

00:33:09.195 --> 00:33:10.822
You know, maybe I will
go up to the roof.

00:33:10.905 --> 00:33:12.323
- Yeah, it's easy
to get to.

00:33:12.407 --> 00:33:13.741
There's a ladder,
right outside.

00:33:13.825 --> 00:33:15.201
- Simon,

00:33:15.284 --> 00:33:16.911
come on,

00:33:16.994 --> 00:33:18.663
I'm not oblivious.

00:33:18.746 --> 00:33:20.123
I'll put a pillow
over my ears.

00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:21.124
[Eden gasps]

00:33:21.207 --> 00:33:22.375
- Nathanael,

00:33:22.458 --> 00:33:24.043
you can say whatever you want
when we're on the road,

00:33:24.127 --> 00:33:25.378
but in my house,

00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:28.464
try having a thought
you don't say, hmm?

00:33:28.548 --> 00:33:32.093
Or you'll be sleeping
in the fish hold.

00:33:32.176 --> 00:33:33.720
- Sorry.

00:33:41.477 --> 00:33:43.104
[whispering] You still
want me to go up to the roof.

00:33:43.187 --> 00:33:45.148
- Yes!

00:33:45.231 --> 00:33:46.482
- Okay.

00:33:46.566 --> 00:33:47.650
Yep.

00:33:51.154 --> 00:33:53.197
- Oh, good.
[tap-tap]

00:33:53.281 --> 00:33:54.449
This is the place.

00:33:56.909 --> 00:33:57.702
Nice.

00:33:57.785 --> 00:33:58.828
- Mm-hmm.

00:34:01.247 --> 00:34:03.124
[market noise]

00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:07.920
- Slow down.

00:34:08.004 --> 00:34:08.921
- What?

00:34:09.005 --> 00:34:10.798
You're not eager
to get home?

00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:13.342
- Yes, and you're not
the one carrying the axe

00:34:13.426 --> 00:34:14.635
and the tent poles

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:17.013
and the hammer
and these bowls--

00:34:17.096 --> 00:34:18.347
- Shut up.

00:34:18.431 --> 00:34:19.348
Let's switch.

00:34:20.266 --> 00:34:21.225
- Okay.

00:34:23.102 --> 00:34:24.437
There.

00:34:26.606 --> 00:34:27.523
[Big James grunts]

00:34:27.607 --> 00:34:29.067
- Why are you
in such a rush, anyway?

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.359
- C'mon.

00:34:30.443 --> 00:34:31.486
You don't know?

00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:32.653
- What?

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:35.656
- John, I wake up
every morning

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:36.699
and after every nap

00:34:36.783 --> 00:34:38.576
having dreamt
about just one thing.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:40.620
- You're going
to tell me what, I'll bet.

00:34:40.703 --> 00:34:42.163
- Eema's
cinnamon cakes.

00:34:42.246 --> 00:34:44.332
- That sounds
about right.

00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:45.500
- And you don't?

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:48.044
- Um, well,
there are the teachings.

00:34:48.127 --> 00:34:49.754
And the sermon
we just heard.

00:34:49.837 --> 00:34:52.215
Have you not seen the miracles
He's been performing?

00:34:52.298 --> 00:34:54.300
Paralytics getting up
and walking.

00:34:54.383 --> 00:34:56.094
- I know.

00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:57.845
It makes me
so hungry.

00:34:57.929 --> 00:34:58.721
- You're sick.

00:34:58.805 --> 00:34:59.722
- C'mon.

00:34:59.806 --> 00:35:00.000
We're so close.
