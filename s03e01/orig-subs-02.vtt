00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.259
Are you not of more value
than they?

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:06.514
And which of you
by being anxious

00:05:06.597 --> 00:05:11.811
can add a single hour
to his span of life?

00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:13.730
Therefore do not
be anxious, saying,

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:14.897
"What shall we eat?"

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.108
"What shall we drink?"

00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:20.278
or
"What shall we wear?"

00:05:20.361 --> 00:05:24.323
For the Gentiles
seek all these things,

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:29.996
and your heavenly Father
knows you need them all.

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:33.499
But seek first
the kingdom of God

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:36.252
and His righteousness,

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:40.506
and all these things
will be added to you.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.136
So whatever you wish
that others would do to you,

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:48.556
do also to them,

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.351
for this is the Law
and the Prophets.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:55.271
[in background] Judge not,
that you be not judged.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:57.356
- How's He doing?

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.902
- With the sermon?

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:04.447
The words are the same
as written, but...

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.574
- But now
He's saying them.

00:06:06.657 --> 00:06:08.743
- [tearfully]
Yes.

- You have heard
that it was said,

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:20.690
"An eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth."

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:23.734
But I say to you...

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:26.904
Do not resist
the one who is evil.

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:29.866
And if anyone should slap you
on your right cheek,

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.660
turn and give him
the other one also.

00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:39.208
And if anyone would sue you
and take your tunic,

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.918
let him have
your cloak as well.

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:42.295
You have heard
that it was said,

00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:47.383
"You shall love your neighbor
and hate your enemy."

00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:49.427
But I say to you,

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.679
Love your enemies,

00:07:51.762 --> 00:07:53.890
and pray for those
who persecute you,

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:57.393
so that you may be sons of
your Father who is in heaven.

00:07:57.476 --> 00:07:58.853
How can you say
to your brother,

00:07:58.936 --> 00:07:59.854
"Let me--"

00:07:59.937 --> 00:08:01.314
Consider the lilies
of the field,

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:03.524
how they grow:

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:06.360
they neither toil
nor spin,

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:08.154
yet I tell you--

00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:09.739
Why do you see
the speck

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:12.867
that is in
your brother's eye

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.037
but do not notice the log
in your own eye?

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.917
Your Father knows what you need
before you ask Him.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.336
Pray then like this:

00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:27.548
"Our Father
in heaven...

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:29.133
hallowed
be Your name."

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:31.385
And if anyone should
force you to go one mile,

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:33.721
go with him
two miles.

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:37.767
"Your kingdom come,
Your will be done,

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.020
"on earth
as it is in heaven.

00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:44.815
Give us this day
our daily bread--"

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:47.026
Give to the one
who begs from you.

00:08:47.109 --> 00:08:49.612
"--and forgive us
our debts,

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:52.323
"as we also have
forgiven our debtors.

00:08:55.576 --> 00:08:58.079
"And lead us not
into temptation,

00:08:58.162 --> 00:09:01.332
but deliver us
from evil."

00:09:01.415 --> 00:09:06.379
Do not lay up for yourselves
treasures on earth...

00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:10.007
where moth and rust
destroy

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:12.927
and thieves
break in and steal,

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.013
but lay up for yourselves
treasures in heaven,

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:19.517
where neither moth
nor rust destroys

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.271
and where thieves
do not break in and steal.

00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:26.148
For where
your treasure is,

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.567
there your heart
will be also.

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:31.279
Everyone who hears
these words of mine

00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:33.281
and does not do them

00:09:33.364 --> 00:09:34.907
will be like
a foolish man

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:37.368
who built his house
on the sand.

00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:39.537
And the rain fell,

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.914
and the floods came,

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:45.584
and the winds blew
and beat against that house,

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.753
and it fell,

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:49.880
and great
was the fall of it.

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:52.258
And everyone who hears
these words of mine

00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:54.510
and does them

00:09:54.593 --> 00:09:57.346
will be like
a wise man

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.000
who built his house
on the rock.
