00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.283
And I bring greetings
for Jesus from someone, so...

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:02.868
if I could only
just have a moment--

00:20:02.951 --> 00:20:05.662
- From who?

00:20:05.746 --> 00:20:07.748
- I come
from Machaerus.

00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:10.626
I've spoken with John...
the Baptizer.

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:13.211
- Andrew!

00:20:13.295 --> 00:20:14.379
Come over here.

00:20:16.673 --> 00:20:19.301
She says she's spoken
with John in Machaerus.

00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:20.344
- When?
How?

00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:21.553
You've seen him?

00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:23.263
- Yes, my husband
works in Herod's court,

00:20:23.347 --> 00:20:25.807
so I've had the opportunity
to speak with John

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:28.393
since he's been--well,
since he's been brought in.

00:20:28.477 --> 00:20:31.063
I-I was intrigued
by his words, and I--

00:20:31.146 --> 00:20:31.897
- You've spoken
to him?

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.274
Is he okay--
what did he say?

00:20:35.817 --> 00:20:36.777
- You're Andrew?

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:37.819
- Yes.

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:40.322
- Yes...
he mentioned you.

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:41.406
You were a follower
of his?

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.783
- Yes,
is he hurt?

00:20:42.866 --> 00:20:46.411
- No--
well, um, yes;

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:49.039
it's not a great place
for him to be.

00:20:49.122 --> 00:20:51.583
He's upset
some important people.

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:54.670
But he wanted
you especially, Andrew,

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:56.880
to know that he is
in good spirits.

00:20:56.964 --> 00:20:58.131
- Can I see him?

00:20:58.215 --> 00:20:59.299
- This is Jesus.

00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:03.929
- Yes, of course.

00:21:04.012 --> 00:21:05.389
I saw your teaching.

00:21:05.472 --> 00:21:07.182
- Hello, Joanna.

00:21:07.265 --> 00:21:09.559
So, you've spoken
to My cousin?

00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:10.894
- Yes.

00:21:10.978 --> 00:21:12.145
Yes, John has been
telling me

00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:14.064
that I need to see
Your teachings.

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:15.607
When word reached Machaerus
about this gathering,

00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:16.733
they didn't
think much of it,

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:19.236
but John thought it would be
a good opportunity.

00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:20.904
- Rabbi,
I'd like to visit John.

00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:22.948
- Just a moment,
Andrew.

00:21:23.031 --> 00:21:25.701
So, what will you
report back to him?

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.456
- That I want to support
Your ministry.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.835
This has been a--
[softly crying]

00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:41.258
this has been
a healing day for me...

00:21:41.341 --> 00:21:43.552
as John said
it would be.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.847
Thank you.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.473
- I'm glad
to hear it.

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:54.896
- And John wanted me
to tell You

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.108
that he is eager for You
to come to Herod at some point.

00:21:58.191 --> 00:21:59.276
He believes that--

00:21:59.359 --> 00:22:01.695
that there is uncertainty
in the court about him,

00:22:01.778 --> 00:22:02.654
and he also says that

00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:04.656
they are not
taking You seriously yet.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.910
He thinks that--that
a strong visit from You soon

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:10.787
could resolve
both issues.

00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:12.497
But he also wanted
to make it clear

00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:15.417
that he is trusting
Your timing on "soon."

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.127
[Jesus chuckles]

00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:19.087
- Of course.

00:22:20.547 --> 00:22:22.632
Thank you
for sharing that.

00:22:22.716 --> 00:22:24.468
Now...
so My student here

00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:26.845
doesn't grind his teeth
into dust,

00:22:26.928 --> 00:22:30.182
is John even able to receive
visitors at the moment?

00:22:30.265 --> 00:22:31.683
- Are You coming
to Machaerus?

00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:34.394
- No, I will be
taking some time alone.

00:22:34.478 --> 00:22:36.897
But if you were able
to somehow arrange

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.108
for Andrew here
to safely visit John;

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:41.860
I don't know
if that's possible...

00:22:41.943 --> 00:22:44.529
- Um...

00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:46.990
I suppose that I could
make some arrangements.

00:22:47.074 --> 00:22:48.533
My men are taking me
back to Machaerus

00:22:48.617 --> 00:22:50.744
in my carriage
shortly.

00:22:50.827 --> 00:22:51.745
You can join me.

00:22:51.828 --> 00:22:53.080
[claps]

00:22:53.163 --> 00:22:54.706
- Thank you...
thank you.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.124
Thank you, Rabbi.

00:22:56.208 --> 00:23:00.212
- You need to rest
and to trust, Andrew.

00:23:00.295 --> 00:23:04.174
But perhaps after spending
some time with John

00:23:04.257 --> 00:23:05.592
you'll be able
to do both.

00:23:07.594 --> 00:23:09.221
[Jesus chuckles]

00:23:10.555 --> 00:23:11.306
- Shalom.

00:23:11.389 --> 00:23:13.100
- Shalom,
be safe.

00:23:13.183 --> 00:23:14.059
Shalom.

00:23:14.142 --> 00:23:15.394
- What's, uh,
going on?

00:23:15.477 --> 00:23:16.394
Everything good?

00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:17.896
- We'll leave
in a few moments, hmm?

00:23:19.606 --> 00:23:20.398
- Who is she?

00:23:20.482 --> 00:23:21.358
- I'm going
to see John.

00:23:21.441 --> 00:23:22.484
She's from
Machaerus.

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:23.819
- Oh,
what do you mean?

00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:25.028
This isn't--

00:23:25.112 --> 00:23:26.655
- Rabbi already said
it was all right.

00:23:26.738 --> 00:23:30.408
She works in Herod's court,
don't worry about me.

00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:31.660
You have to
go home--

00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:32.869
- I can't
let you go alone--

00:23:32.953 --> 00:23:33.829
- I'm going
to be fine.

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:34.746
- Andrew--

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.916
- Listen...
I'm going to be fine.

00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:40.919
But...
thank you.

00:23:42.629 --> 00:23:44.131
- For what?

00:23:44.214 --> 00:23:46.675
- For watching out
for me.

00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:47.884
For everyone.

00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:49.219
Always have.

00:23:49.302 --> 00:23:52.973
You're a great leader,
and I don't say it enough so...

00:23:54.724 --> 00:23:55.892
thank you.

00:23:58.812 --> 00:24:00.272
- Say "Shalom" to John
for me.

00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:02.691
- Really?

00:24:02.774 --> 00:24:03.900
- Eh,
I mean it.

00:24:03.984 --> 00:24:06.319
He started all this,
introducing you to Jesus,

00:24:06.403 --> 00:24:08.446
and you introduced me
to Him.

00:24:10.448 --> 00:24:13.535
I thank John...

00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:14.911
and I thank you.

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:18.165
I love you.

00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:21.251
Shalom, man.

00:24:21.334 --> 00:24:22.627
- I love you.

00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:23.503
Shalom.

00:24:23.587 --> 00:24:24.713
[pats back]

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.311
- Whew.

00:24:40.729 --> 00:24:42.314
Ramah.

00:24:48.445 --> 00:24:50.238
- So, uh, did you--
did you talk to John?

00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:52.949
- Yes,
I'll be taken care of.

00:24:53.033 --> 00:24:54.784
And you're all set
with Mary?

00:24:54.868 --> 00:24:56.244
- Yes.

00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:58.121
- Good.

00:24:58.205 --> 00:25:00.000
I'll stop by tomorrow
to check in.
