00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.540
I'll stop by tomorrow
to check in.

00:25:00.624 --> 00:25:02.042
- I figured
you would.

00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:06.671
- Is after second meal
a good time?

00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:07.839
- Hmm...

00:25:07.923 --> 00:25:10.717
I'll have to see
what my plans are.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.512
- Oh, then
I can come later.

00:25:14.596 --> 00:25:15.764
- Thomas,
I'm joking.

00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:18.767
[both laughing]

00:25:19.684 --> 00:25:20.560
It was a joke.

00:25:20.644 --> 00:25:21.686
[laughing]

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.980
- Yes...
of course.

00:25:29.819 --> 00:25:31.404
Well...

00:25:35.992 --> 00:25:36.868
shalom.

00:25:36.952 --> 00:25:37.953
- Shalom.

00:25:41.081 --> 00:25:41.915
Uh, Thomas?

00:25:42.749 --> 00:25:43.750
- Yes?

00:25:45.335 --> 00:25:47.212
- Um...

00:25:47.295 --> 00:25:48.296
- Yes?

00:25:50.173 --> 00:25:52.968
- Maybe come by
after first meal?

00:25:55.345 --> 00:25:56.805
- Of course.

00:25:56.888 --> 00:25:58.640
I just didn't want
to bother you,

00:25:58.723 --> 00:26:03.520
it's been quite a lot of time
together lately.

00:26:03.603 --> 00:26:04.896
- I know.

00:26:09.025 --> 00:26:12.654
I just--I hope
this time away

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:16.992
doesn't become too much...
time away.

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:18.952
- It won't.

00:26:19.035 --> 00:26:20.161
- Good.

00:26:23.164 --> 00:26:24.207
Shalom.

00:26:27.335 --> 00:26:28.336
- Shalom.

00:26:34.217 --> 00:26:35.844

[quill clinks in empty inkwell]

00:27:10.211 --> 00:27:11.212
- Hello?

00:27:12.756 --> 00:27:14.090
- Hello.

00:27:14.174 --> 00:27:15.717
- Are you...

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.344
Who are you?

00:27:17.427 --> 00:27:18.845
- I'm Jairus.

00:27:18.928 --> 00:27:19.721
- Nice to meet you.

00:27:19.804 --> 00:27:21.014
I'm Yussif.

00:27:21.097 --> 00:27:23.266
Uh, is Niv here?

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:25.101
- Niv was
transferred.

00:27:25.185 --> 00:27:27.812
I'm the new synagogue
administrator.

00:27:27.896 --> 00:27:28.855
- I had no idea.

00:27:28.938 --> 00:27:29.981
- That he
was leaving?

00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:32.734
- That I'm so unimportant
no one would mention it.

00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:35.362
- [laughs]

00:27:35.445 --> 00:27:38.740
I would not trouble myself,
Rabbi Yussif.

00:27:38.823 --> 00:27:42.619
Take it from someone who
transferred many times over,

00:27:42.702 --> 00:27:44.287
the goodbyes
are hardest.

00:27:44.371 --> 00:27:46.247
It seems Niv kept
this information to himself

00:27:46.331 --> 00:27:47.749
to avoid having
to say them.

00:27:47.832 --> 00:27:49.167
- You've been
around then?

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:52.629
- Kadesh, Joppa,
Hebron, and now...

00:27:52.712 --> 00:27:54.047
- Galilee.

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.049
Welcome, Jairus.

00:27:56.132 --> 00:27:57.300
Do you have family?

00:27:57.384 --> 00:27:58.676
- A wife
and daughter.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.970
And, Adonai willing,
another child on the way.

00:28:01.054 --> 00:28:02.389
- Ah,
congratulations.

00:28:02.472 --> 00:28:03.390
- Thank you,
rabbi.

00:28:03.473 --> 00:28:04.724
And what about
your family?

00:28:04.808 --> 00:28:05.892
I hope to
meet them soon.

00:28:05.975 --> 00:28:07.811
- My family
is in Jerusalem.

00:28:07.894 --> 00:28:10.188
- Ah,
that must be hard.

00:28:10.271 --> 00:28:11.106
I'm sorry.

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:12.023
- I was uncertain

00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:14.401
how long I would
remain in Capernaum.

00:28:14.484 --> 00:28:17.487
Moving around so much
is difficult as well.

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:18.613
Your daughter.

00:28:18.696 --> 00:28:20.156
How old is she?

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.158
- Twelve.

00:28:22.242 --> 00:28:25.703
It is difficult for her,
making friends.

00:28:25.787 --> 00:28:28.164
My wife, too,
but...

00:28:28.248 --> 00:28:30.959
being isolated
brings us closer.

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:32.669
And I assure you,

00:28:32.752 --> 00:28:35.213
it will not prevent me
from doing my duty.

00:28:35.296 --> 00:28:37.090
- Of course not.

00:28:37.173 --> 00:28:40.844
Jairus,
I need ink.

00:28:40.927 --> 00:28:42.095
- You and everyone.

00:28:42.178 --> 00:28:42.971
- We're out?

00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:44.889
- Dry,
I'm afraid.

00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:47.100
I put in a request
with the Elders.

00:28:47.183 --> 00:28:48.268
Until then,

00:28:48.351 --> 00:28:51.813
you may want to check
with some of your less...

00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:53.189
prolific brethren.

00:28:53.273 --> 00:28:55.775
- If I did, I'd have
to explain what I'm writing.

00:28:55.859 --> 00:28:58.486
I'll use
my personal stores.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:28:59.988
Thank you.

00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:03.700
- I enjoy a challenge,
Rabbi Yussif.

00:29:03.783 --> 00:29:05.201
- That will
serve you well here.

00:29:05.285 --> 00:29:08.788
- It's one of the reasons
I've been moved around.

00:29:08.872 --> 00:29:13.418
I have a propensity for
bringing order amidst chaos.

00:29:16.212 --> 00:29:17.755
Perhaps I'm being
dramatic.

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:20.008
Upheaval?

00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:23.011
Unusual events?

00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:27.098
Word has spread of unusual
things happening in Capernaum.

00:29:27.182 --> 00:29:30.643
- That's
an apt description.

00:29:30.727 --> 00:29:33.521
- Are you, perhaps,
writing of unusual things?

00:29:37.484 --> 00:29:38.610
- The most.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:45.867
Yesterday, I saw a sermon
by a rogue preacher.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.328
I haven't slept since.

00:29:48.411 --> 00:29:50.288
He was brilliant!

00:29:50.371 --> 00:29:51.623
- Intriguing.

00:29:53.583 --> 00:29:55.543
Is it to be
a historical record?

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:57.545
A letter?

00:29:57.629 --> 00:29:58.838
Are you filing
charges--

00:29:58.922 --> 00:29:59.881
- No!

00:29:59.964 --> 00:30:00.000
I... I don't know
what I'm writing yet
