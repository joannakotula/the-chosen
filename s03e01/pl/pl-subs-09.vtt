00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.940
- But curious.

00:40:01.023 --> 00:40:04.276
- I think she was
being cautious but genuine.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.153
She had on
silver earrings.

00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:07.446
- Or it was all talk

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.115
and we'll never
see her again,

00:40:09.198 --> 00:40:10.282
which is fine
with me.

00:40:11.951 --> 00:40:13.202
We're giving away
Shahtoosh?

00:40:13.285 --> 00:40:15.246
That's the most expensive
textile in the world.

00:40:15.329 --> 00:40:16.747
- She was trying
to help us, Ramah.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:19.750
- Why don't we just eat,
hmm?

00:40:21.502 --> 00:40:23.129
- [sighs]

00:40:23.212 --> 00:40:24.296
Yes.

PALACE GUARD: I can't say that
I blame you for coming back.

00:40:33.722 --> 00:40:36.058
We don't get interesting ones
down here often.

00:40:36.142 --> 00:40:38.352
Every day it is
something new with him.

00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:40.980
Either demanding we pass
a message to Herod

00:40:41.063 --> 00:40:42.648
or preaching about
a new kingdom.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.694
His insults
are very creative.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.619
- It will be
embarrassing to me

00:40:55.703 --> 00:40:57.413
if you tell anyone
about my visit

00:40:57.496 --> 00:40:59.790
or my friend
being with me.

00:40:59.874 --> 00:41:04.170
But to you and your family
it will be devastating!

00:41:11.093 --> 00:41:12.678

never here.

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:25.399
- John?

00:41:25.482 --> 00:41:27.818
John...
are you all right?

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:33.699
- What are you
doing here?

00:41:33.782 --> 00:41:34.658
Who allowed this?

00:41:34.742 --> 00:41:35.910
- No one.

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:37.244
We should be quick.

00:41:39.538 --> 00:41:41.165
- I'll be fine.

00:41:41.248 --> 00:41:42.249
Think of it
this way...

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:44.210
I've never gotten to sleep
in a palace before.

[both chuckle]

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:47.588
But what are you
doing here?

00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:50.591
- I've been so worried,
praying for you every day.

00:41:50.674 --> 00:41:52.718
- You've got
a new rabbi now.

00:41:52.801 --> 00:41:54.345
The Rabbi.

00:41:54.428 --> 00:41:56.055
Focus on Him.

00:41:56.138 --> 00:41:58.849
And hopefully I'll be able
to as well soon enough.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:04.480
She came to me in distress
after Herod arrested me.

00:42:04.563 --> 00:42:06.148
Not for my sake.

00:42:06.232 --> 00:42:08.859
She was angry I didn't call out
her husband's adultery

00:42:08.943 --> 00:42:10.402
when I accused Herod.

00:42:10.486 --> 00:42:13.030
[laughing]

00:42:13.113 --> 00:42:16.242
But she is proving
an apt pupil.

00:42:16.325 --> 00:42:17.326
Did you talk to Him?

00:42:17.409 --> 00:42:20.120
- Yes, I told Him
everything you told me.

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:22.748
- Thank you,
but that's not as important.

00:42:22.831 --> 00:42:24.124
What do you
think of Him?

00:42:26.627 --> 00:42:28.170
- I don't know
how to describe it.

00:42:28.254 --> 00:42:29.547
- Like you are
grateful for food

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:32.925
and didn't realize
you'd been starving.

00:42:33.008 --> 00:42:35.886
- That works.
[chuckles]

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.347
- Anything new?

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:39.765
- So much!

00:42:39.848 --> 00:42:41.308
- Tell me
what He said.

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:43.686
- Nothing
that made sense.

Everything

the meek, all elevated.

And other things reversed...

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:55.823
Who can love
their enemy?

- He can.

00:42:57.283 --> 00:42:58.367
What else?

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:00.536
- Bizarre imagery,
like...

00:43:00.619 --> 00:43:03.539
something about
pearls before pigs,

00:43:03.622 --> 00:43:04.832

as you, John.

- Oh, I wish
I were so strange.

were there?

- Thousands.

- Thousands.

Wonderful,

How--how
can I help?

- Help?

You're helping me
by what you're sharing.

- You know
what I mean.

of Isaiah...

He has been sent to proclaim
liberty to the captives,

and what...?

00:43:58.761 --> 00:44:00.721
- The opening of the prison
to those who are bound.

00:44:00.804 --> 00:44:02.014
- Yes!

00:44:02.097 --> 00:44:06.602
This prison is nothing
now that He is here!

00:44:06.685 --> 00:44:08.312
Do you believe that?

00:44:10.814 --> 00:44:13.233
- I--I'm trying.

00:44:14.902 --> 00:44:16.236
- Andrew...

00:44:17.988 --> 00:44:21.283
in all that He said to
those thousands of people,

00:44:21.367 --> 00:44:24.161
there was something
just for you...

00:44:24.244 --> 00:44:26.663
for what you
are going through.

00:44:26.747 --> 00:44:27.915
There always is.

00:44:30.125 --> 00:44:31.251
What was it?

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.755
Something that
stuck with you.

00:44:37.883 --> 00:44:39.468
- [tearfully]
Don't be anxious.

00:44:41.428 --> 00:44:46.433
Can--can you add a single hour
to your life

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:48.268
by being anxious?

00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:51.230
- That sounds like Him.

00:44:51.313 --> 00:44:52.314
What else?

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.194
- But seek first--

00:44:57.277 --> 00:45:00.000
seek first
the kingdom of God
