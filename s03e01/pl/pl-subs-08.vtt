00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.890
We're so close.

00:35:02.517 --> 00:35:03.351
- You guys
going to eat?

00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:04.310
- Thomas!

00:35:04.393 --> 00:35:05.645
- Everybody's hungry.

00:35:05.728 --> 00:35:06.979
Glad to see
you found the place.

00:35:09.106 --> 00:35:10.233
- Wasn't easy.

00:35:10.316 --> 00:35:13.402
Your directions are...
what's the word?

00:35:13.486 --> 00:35:14.362
Bad.

00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:16.280
- There was a plan?

00:35:16.364 --> 00:35:18.783
- Well, I figured a guy
from the plains of Sharon--

00:35:18.866 --> 00:35:21.077
a stranger
from a strange place--

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.912
could do worse
than Abba's.

00:35:22.995 --> 00:35:24.288
What?

00:35:24.372 --> 00:35:26.874
He can sleep in that room
where Eema dries the herbs.

00:35:27.917 --> 00:35:29.377
- That's fine.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.795
Glad to have you,
Thomas.

00:35:32.588 --> 00:35:34.048
- Didn't I tell you?

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:36.467
I guess my mind's been on
all this history making.

00:35:36.551 --> 00:35:38.261
While he's been
thinking about cakes.

00:35:38.344 --> 00:35:39.220
- What kind of cakes?

00:35:39.303 --> 00:35:40.596
- Forget it.

00:35:41.514 --> 00:35:43.724
ZEBEDEE: Three disciples
of Jesus of Nazareth

00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:46.018
coming to stay
under my roof!

00:35:46.102 --> 00:35:47.562
A triple blessing!

00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:48.855
- Abba knew?

00:35:48.938 --> 00:35:50.940
- Yeah, Thomas and I
talked to him; come on.

00:35:54.735 --> 00:35:57.321
- Of all the fathers
in Capernaum,

00:35:57.405 --> 00:35:59.448
I must be
the most envied!

00:35:59.532 --> 00:36:00.575
- Hello, Abba.

00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:02.285
- Hello.

00:36:02.368 --> 00:36:03.286
- Abba.

00:36:03.369 --> 00:36:04.579
[grunts with hug]

00:36:04.662 --> 00:36:05.746
- I'd introduce you
to Thomas

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.206
but it seems
you've already met.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:08.958
- Thomas!

00:36:09.041 --> 00:36:09.959
Thomas!

00:36:10.042 --> 00:36:10.960
- Zebedee.

00:36:11.043 --> 00:36:11.919
[chuckling]

00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:13.337
- Ohhh...
[pats back]

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.590
How 'bout that sermon?

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.008
- I have
some questions.

00:36:17.091 --> 00:36:18.217
- [mimics him]
"I have some questions."

00:36:18.301 --> 00:36:19.343
[laughs]

00:36:19.427 --> 00:36:20.678
I thought
you would.

00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:21.846
- I tend
to overthink things.

00:36:21.929 --> 00:36:22.805
- Mm.

00:36:22.889 --> 00:36:23.890
- Where's Eema?

00:36:23.973 --> 00:36:25.141
- She ran to market.

00:36:25.224 --> 00:36:27.602
Realized at the last minute
she was out of cinnamon.

00:36:30.813 --> 00:36:32.148
- I've got something
very important

00:36:32.231 --> 00:36:33.774
I want to talk
to you all about.

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:36.235
- Ohhh... I think
I know what it is!

00:36:36.319 --> 00:36:37.820
- I definitely
think I know.

00:36:37.904 --> 00:36:40.489
- Mm,
Mm-hmm-mm-mm.

00:36:40.573 --> 00:36:41.866
- Let's talk more
about it.

00:36:43.659 --> 00:36:44.952
- I don't know what
you're talking about?

00:36:47.246 --> 00:36:48.372
Abba.

00:36:58.049 --> 00:37:00.509
- I have nothing
in the cupboards.

00:37:00.593 --> 00:37:01.886
I didn't know
when I'd get back,

00:37:01.969 --> 00:37:04.221
so I gave everything
to my friend, Rivka.

00:37:08.225 --> 00:37:09.393
Oh.

00:37:09.477 --> 00:37:10.645
Yeah.

00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:12.438
I know.

00:37:12.521 --> 00:37:13.564
- What?

00:37:13.648 --> 00:37:16.108
- It's tiny.

00:37:16.192 --> 00:37:18.110
- Ah, nooo,
no, no, no.

00:37:18.194 --> 00:37:20.821
You'll sleep here,
yes?

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:26.243
And, uh, I will sleep...
along that wall.

00:37:26.327 --> 00:37:29.789
And then Tamar,
you can sleep there?

00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:34.835
- It's intimate.

00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:37.171
- It'll stay...
warm.

00:37:38.631 --> 00:37:41.634
[laughing]

00:37:41.717 --> 00:37:44.011
- Yes,
it will be warm.

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:45.596
[chuckling]

00:37:47.807 --> 00:37:48.975
Mary...

00:37:49.058 --> 00:37:50.268
may I bring
some light in here?

00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:51.227
- Please!

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:52.269
- Okay.

00:37:52.353 --> 00:37:53.354
- TAMAR:
Ah, there we go.

00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:57.733
RAMAH: Well,
we spent our last shekel.

00:37:57.817 --> 00:38:00.361
Let's hope this goes
a long way.

00:38:02.697 --> 00:38:03.906
- There we are.

00:38:08.077 --> 00:38:08.995
- What is it?

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:13.791
- Matthew?

00:38:13.874 --> 00:38:14.875
- Oh.

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:16.794
Uh, hello.

00:38:16.877 --> 00:38:18.671
- What are you
doing here?

00:38:18.754 --> 00:38:23.259
- I'm not sure who to...
or where to, um... go.

00:38:25.177 --> 00:38:26.178
- You have a home

00:38:26.262 --> 00:38:27.680
in one of the most
beautiful neighbor--

00:38:27.763 --> 00:38:29.515
- I gave it away.

00:38:29.598 --> 00:38:30.891
- To whom?

00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:32.309
- My parents.

00:38:32.393 --> 00:38:34.645
- Have you stopped by
their house?

00:38:34.729 --> 00:38:36.981
- My father
will not allow it.

00:38:37.064 --> 00:38:39.358
- But you're his son.

00:38:39.442 --> 00:38:42.194
- He--
he says I am not.

00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:46.532
- I'm sorry.

00:38:49.201 --> 00:38:50.244
- Thank you
for listening.

00:38:53.914 --> 00:38:55.166
I think perhaps
I'll make camp.

00:38:55.249 --> 00:38:56.584
I know how
to do it now.

00:38:58.044 --> 00:38:59.420
- Are you okay,
Matthew?

00:38:59.503 --> 00:39:01.213
- I feel confused.

00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:03.257
Thank you for asking,
Ramah.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.135
- You're doing
really good, Matthew.

00:39:07.928 --> 00:39:08.846
Everything's new,

00:39:08.929 --> 00:39:10.848
it's okay
to make a mistake.

00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:15.061
[♪ woman vocalizing ♪]

00:39:15.144 --> 00:39:16.395
- Thank you, Mary.

00:39:17.772 --> 00:39:18.898
Have a good night.

00:39:23.652 --> 00:39:25.821
- He's wonderful.

00:39:25.905 --> 00:39:27.198
He's a good man.

00:39:30.451 --> 00:39:34.580
It's not much...
but we'll manage.

00:39:34.663 --> 00:39:38.125
- Is it too early
to use this shawl?

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:39.460
- Yes!

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:41.837
We should not
have taken it.

00:39:41.921 --> 00:39:42.838
- She got to you.

00:39:42.922 --> 00:39:44.590
- Well, she was
presumptuous.

00:39:44.673 --> 00:39:46.550
- Sometimes rich people
can be like that.

00:39:46.634 --> 00:39:48.052
- Believe me,
I know,

00:39:48.135 --> 00:39:49.720
I used to work in
the wedding business.

00:39:49.804 --> 00:39:51.514
- Who do you think
she was?

00:39:51.597 --> 00:39:53.557
Remember how she
struggled with her words?

00:39:53.641 --> 00:39:54.850
- I don't think
she wanted anyone

00:39:54.934 --> 00:39:56.102
to know
she was there.

00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:57.311
That's what I got
from her.

00:39:57.394 --> 00:39:58.312
- Yes!

00:39:58.395 --> 00:39:59.814
She was deceptive.

00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:00.000
- But curious.
