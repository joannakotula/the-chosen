00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.182
who built his house
on the rock.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.184
And the rain fell,

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:04.020
and the floods came,

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:07.982
and the winds blew
and beat on that house,

00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:10.651
but it
did not fall,

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:14.655
because it had been founded
on the rock.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:17.325
[crowd noise]

00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:18.743
PILGRIM 1: You ever hear
anything like that?

00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:20.202
PILGRIM 2: Not that
kind of authority.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:21.912
He spoke with
actual authority.

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.748
His own,
not from someone else.

00:10:23.831 --> 00:10:25.374
- Yes,
almost above the law.

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:26.417
- Shhh!

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:28.586
BARNABY: Consider
the lilies, He said!

00:10:28.669 --> 00:10:31.005
How they neither
toil nor spin--

00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:31.964
- --Yet I tell you,

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:33.215
even Solomon
in all his glory--

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.633
- --was not like
one of these.

00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:36.719
[crowd noise]

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:44.185
- Judas!

00:10:44.268 --> 00:10:45.978
- Hadad!

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:47.521
- I lost you.

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:48.731
Did you find
those guys?

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:49.815
- I stood with
His followers.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.525
- Could you see
the people's faces?

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:53.277
I've never seen
a crowd so moved.

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:54.320
The "turn the other cheek

00:10:54.403 --> 00:10:55.738
and lay up treasures in heaven"
business

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:56.655
was a little naive,

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:58.657
but this man
has talent!

00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:00.534
- No, I've never seen
anything like it.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.244
- Could you imagine
if He sold for us?

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.204
- Hadad?

00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:04.455
- Why didn't they
take up a collection?

00:11:04.538 --> 00:11:05.790
They could be
living like kings.

00:11:05.873 --> 00:11:06.957
- I'm going
with them.

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:09.126
- What?

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.711
- I'm leaving.

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.088
I quit.

00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:13.839
I'm going with
His followers.

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.300
- [chuckles]
Where?

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:18.552
- I don't know.

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.596
The ends
of the earth.

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:23.474
Everywhere this message
needs to be heard.

00:11:23.557 --> 00:11:25.434
- I'll sue you.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:26.685
- I renounce
my shares.

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.062
- I'll sue Him!

00:11:28.145 --> 00:11:30.940
- [scoffs] There is nothing
you could take from Him

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:33.567
that'd be of
any value to you.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.486
- What does He have
to give you then?

00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:37.822
[sighs]

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:40.825
[pats back]

00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:44.412
- Good luck,
Hadad.

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:55.131
- Well?

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:56.465
- Hmm.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:59.051
- My thoughts
exactly.

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.721
See you in the morning then
for our report to Quintus.

00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:02.805
- Mm-hmm.

00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:06.851
[Atticus chuckles]

00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:11.897
- Good chat.

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:18.737
- Thank you,
Eden.

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.239
Thank you,
Eema.

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:23.659
Mm.

00:12:24.952 --> 00:12:26.412
Ah, thank you.

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:29.123
[crowd conversations]

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:33.169
MATTHEW:
I was able to write down

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:34.211
many of the new things
You said,

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.255
but not all of them.

00:12:36.338 --> 00:12:37.840
- That's fine.

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:39.800
I will say them again
and we can discuss them then.

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.802
MATTHEW: I recognize
some of them from my studies

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:43.679
of the teachings
of Rabbi Hillel.

00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:45.139
- That's very good,
Matthew.

00:12:45.222 --> 00:12:46.640
- When you said to
be reconciled to your brother,

00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:47.683
can you
elaborate on--

00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:49.518
- Matthew...

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:50.519
perhaps we can
talk about this

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:51.604
some other time?

00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:54.106
I'm very hungry,

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.649
and I would love to chat
with our new friend

00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:57.067
about a few things.

00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:00.362
- Oh... I'm sorry,
I can come back.

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:01.739
- No, no, no,
no, it's okay.

00:13:01.822 --> 00:13:03.908
I'm gathering everyone
together shortly.

00:13:03.991 --> 00:13:06.494
I would love
to speak with you.

00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:07.786
Matthew, can you help
James and John

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.580
gather the others?

00:13:09.663 --> 00:13:10.915
- Right now?

00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:12.041
- Mm-hmm.

00:13:15.002 --> 00:13:16.128
Matthew...

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:19.590
thank you
for helping me.

00:13:21.842 --> 00:13:23.219
- Yes, Rabbi.

00:13:34.855 --> 00:13:37.441
- So...

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:40.778
- I'm Judas
of Kerioth.

00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:42.738
- Shalom, Judas.

00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:43.989
- Shalom.

00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:47.076
- I saw you before I stepped
out to talk to the people,

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:49.119
and then I noticed you
listening very intently

00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:51.288
during My sermon.

00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:52.831
- It was wonderful.

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:54.500
- Thank you.

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:56.460
And then Nathanael
briefly told me

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:57.711
how you
gave us help

00:13:57.795 --> 00:14:01.966
and how you might be
interested in joining us.

00:14:02.049 --> 00:14:04.176
He's not easy
to impress.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.761
- Ah.

00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:07.137
I attended
beit midrash,

00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:08.764
but my father
passed away

00:14:08.847 --> 00:14:10.182
before I could
pursue a rabbi,

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:11.475
so I stayed home
to work.

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:15.813
I would like
to follow You.

00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:16.855
- You would?

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:18.315
- Very much.

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:19.858
I may not be
a soldier in battle,

00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:21.860
but I have business
and financial skills,

00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:23.612
that I would
like to use

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:26.865
to spread this ministry
far and wide,

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:28.659
as fast as possible.

00:14:28.742 --> 00:14:29.994
I did attend
the beit midrash.

00:14:30.077 --> 00:14:32.413
[Jesus chuckling]

00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:33.747
I heard you
the first time.

00:14:35.457 --> 00:14:37.585
I do not require that
of My followers;

00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:40.129
you would actually
be one of the few.

00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:44.258
I only require
what other rabbis do...

00:14:44.341 --> 00:14:45.968
that you seek
to be like Me.

00:14:47.511 --> 00:14:48.596
- Of course.

00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:50.556
- But that will be
much more difficult with Me

00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:53.809
than with other rabbis,
I can assure you.

00:14:53.892 --> 00:14:55.352
Are you ready
to do hard things?

00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:00.000
- I believe You are going
to change the world...
