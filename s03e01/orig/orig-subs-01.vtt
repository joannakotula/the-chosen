00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:37.537
- Alphaeus bar Jehoram?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.957
- Yes.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.667
- You are 20 days
past your deadline

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:44.294
for this quarter's tribute.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.045
Your collector has transferred
your case to the Roman office.

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.756
Are you able to pay
your tribute penalty now?

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.174
- I filed an extension
in the month of--

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:50.425
- I'll take that
as a no.

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:51.885
By decree of Quintus,
honorable Praetor of Capernaum,

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:53.094
I will remand you
into custody.

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.512
- I'm very sorry,
I didn't realize--

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:55.430
- Turn around.

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:56.556
- Sir,
I didn't realize.

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:58.475
May I request an extension
of just five days?

- Alphaeus?

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:04.981
Who is it?

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:06.608
- Everything's fine,
Elisheva!

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:07.817
Please,
I beg you...

Adonai in heaven.

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:13.490
MATTHEW: I can
settle this, Lucius.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:18.536
There's actually
been a mistake.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.621
- What do you mean?

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.873
You told me to--

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:23.124
- I am aware,
but...

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:26.085
I've realized the timelines
were miscalculated.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:28.296
I will clear it up,
thank you.

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.799
- You...
miscalculated?

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:33.176
- I received
inaccurate information,

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.055
and I--it's being
corrected right now.

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:38.681
I will handle this,

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.308
it would be best if you
went to our next house,

00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:42.644
and I will meet you
at the booth in one hour.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:57.617
- Are you...?

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.868
- It isn't prudent
to discuss this now, Abba,

00:01:58.952 --> 00:01:59.702
we don't have much--

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.205
- First the shame
of your choice...

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:05.166
and now you are actually
my collector?

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.668
ELISHEVA
- Matthew?

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:09.838
What are you
doing here?

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:12.215
- Your son
is our publicanus.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:13.925
- Matthew,
no!!

00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:15.718
- He sent a soldier
to your home.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.137
- I'm sorry,
I didn't want you to know,

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:19.389
I didn't choose
this district.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.224
- You chose
this job!

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.893
The Romans never
forced you into it,

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.855
you chose to apply,
you chose to betray--

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:28.356
- I chose
a secure future.

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.983
- You are called
to trust in Adonai

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.150
with all your heart,

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:32.777
and not lean on
your own understanding.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.070
- I have trusted!

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:36.573
Can you name one thing Adonai
has done for our people...

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:39.742
in a hundred
years?

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:40.785
Five hundred?

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:41.828
- Matthew.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:43.913
- A traitor
and a blasphemer.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:44.998
- Well.

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:46.875
You owe your government
two months of tribute.

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.835
- I will bring in a payment
by the end of the week.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:51.713
- You've missed
two payments.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.133
I was hoping Lucius
could convince you,

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:56.551
but I will no longer
protect you.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:57.635
- I don't want
your protection.

00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:01.848
- Then you have
24 hours, Abba.

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:03.516
- Don't call me
"Abba."

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.851
- Alphaeus,
please.

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:07.145
- What?

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:10.982
- Elli, cover the windows,
put on your veil.

00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:12.609
We will sit shiva
for seven days.

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:20.742
[Elisheva cries]

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:25.121
I have no son.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:35.465
[door slams]

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:45.892
JESUS: You have heard that
it was said to those of old,

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.268
"You shall not murder;

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:51.356
and whomever murders
will be liable to judgment."

00:03:53.107 --> 00:03:54.692
But I say to you,

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:57.362
everyone who is angry
with his brother

00:03:57.445 --> 00:03:59.906
will be liable
to judgment.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.159
So if you are offering
your gift at the altar,

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:04.619
and there remember
that your brother

00:04:04.702 --> 00:04:06.913
has something
against you,

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:12.293
leave your gift there
before the altar and go.

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:16.422
First, be reconciled
to your brother,

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:18.466
and then come
and offer your gift.

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.427
[softly crying]

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:24.514
Therefore,
I tell you,

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:28.476
do not be anxious
about your life...

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:31.896
what you will eat
or what you will drink,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.317
nor about your body,
what you will put on.

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:41.614
Is not life
more than food...

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.825
and the body
more than clothing?

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:50.748
Look at the birds
of the air:

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.418
they neither sow
nor reap

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.044
nor gather
into barns,

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.088
yet your heavenly Father
feeds them.

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:00.000
Are you not of more value
than they?
