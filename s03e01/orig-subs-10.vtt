00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:00.197
seek first
the kingdom of God

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.573
and His
righteousness.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.827
- Even more like Him.

00:45:10.416 --> 00:45:11.708
So if you want
to help me--

00:45:11.792 --> 00:45:13.752
Andrew?

00:45:13.836 --> 00:45:17.965
If you want to help me...
listen to Him.

00:45:19.967 --> 00:45:22.803
Go home...

00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:24.054
and do what He says.

00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:27.057
That's what I want.

00:45:30.227 --> 00:45:31.228
Got it?

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:39.194
Now, let Joanna get you out
of here so you don't join me.

00:45:45.659 --> 00:45:47.953
[birdsong]

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:58.505
[pats bag]

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.725
[papers rustling]

00:46:32.414 --> 00:46:33.707
[door clinks open]

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:49.431
[door closes]

00:46:50.974 --> 00:46:53.268
[market sounds]

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.745
JUDAS: Working hard,
I see.

00:47:13.455 --> 00:47:15.958
[Dvorah laughs]

00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:19.628
- Why do I have
a bad feeling about this?

00:47:19.711 --> 00:47:21.505
- That's what you said when
I joined the mining company.

00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:23.757
- And now
you're leaving it.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.676
- My life can't
just be about money.

00:47:25.759 --> 00:47:27.427
- It's never not
about money with you.

00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:29.805
- I know you think

00:47:29.888 --> 00:47:30.973
you would've spent
Abba's inheritance

00:47:31.056 --> 00:47:32.099
better than I have.

00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:33.267
- I would have.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:35.143
That house you invested in
has not gone up in value.

00:47:37.813 --> 00:47:39.022
- That's why
I'm here.

00:47:40.857 --> 00:47:41.984
I need you to hold
something for me.

00:47:42.067 --> 00:47:44.486
Well, two things,
actually...

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:47.698
[market sounds]

00:47:52.494 --> 00:47:54.955
It's the deed
to my house.

00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:55.872
- What?

00:47:55.956 --> 00:47:57.165
- I don't know
when I'll be back--

00:47:57.249 --> 00:48:00.002
or if
I'll be back.

00:48:07.801 --> 00:48:11.179
- Everyone's been talking
about your rabbi, you know?

00:48:11.263 --> 00:48:12.306
- What are they saying?

00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:14.224
- Too many things
to be true.

00:48:14.308 --> 00:48:15.976
I heard hundreds
of people gathered.

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:17.561
- Thousands!

00:48:17.644 --> 00:48:19.521
I didn't know it
at the time but,

00:48:19.605 --> 00:48:20.606
the day before,

00:48:20.689 --> 00:48:23.233
I helped His disciples
secure the site.

00:48:23.317 --> 00:48:25.402
God worked through me,
Dvorah.

00:48:25.485 --> 00:48:28.030
That's--that's
never happened before.

00:48:28.113 --> 00:48:29.364
- How will you
make money?

00:48:29.448 --> 00:48:30.782
It's the only work
you've ever known.

00:48:30.866 --> 00:48:33.702
- I will help with
what little they do have.

00:48:33.785 --> 00:48:36.163
Help find benefactors,
supporters.

00:48:36.246 --> 00:48:38.999
Most ministries and rabbis
are inefficient,

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:40.751
and this is
the most important ministry

00:48:40.834 --> 00:48:43.170
of our people's
history.

00:48:43.253 --> 00:48:44.504
To spread
His message,

00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:47.716
and to build something
to match the Romans,

00:48:47.799 --> 00:48:48.967
they'll need
my skills.

00:48:49.051 --> 00:48:50.677
- Judas,
this is dangerous.

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:51.678
- Yes.

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:52.804
- Rome doesn't like
popular preachers

00:48:52.888 --> 00:48:54.097
with big followings.

00:48:54.181 --> 00:48:56.224
They put them away.

00:48:56.308 --> 00:48:58.518
- I think
He's the Messiah.

00:48:58.602 --> 00:48:59.770
I'm almost sure
of it.

00:48:59.853 --> 00:49:01.188
- Many have claimed
to be the Messiah.

00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:02.356
You know what happens
to them?

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:04.149
- Always the worst-case
scenario with you.

00:49:04.232 --> 00:49:07.611
You know, their followers
aren't... always killed.

00:49:10.489 --> 00:49:11.615
[sighs]

00:49:13.283 --> 00:49:17.663
If He is the Anointed One,
sister,

00:49:17.746 --> 00:49:20.707
then He will not
be killed.

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:24.503
He will defeat the Romans
and set us all free.

00:49:24.586 --> 00:49:28.090
- I don't want
to lose you, Judas.

00:49:28.173 --> 00:49:30.133
You're all I have left
in this world.

00:49:30.217 --> 00:49:32.928
- Oh, you have
your husband,

00:49:33.011 --> 00:49:34.596
your beautiful
daughters.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.139
- No, I mean...

00:49:38.183 --> 00:49:39.351
You know
what I mean.

00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:44.231
You're the last
of our name.

00:49:44.314 --> 00:49:47.734
If something
was to happen to you...

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:49.695
the line of Iscariot
will be broken

00:49:49.778 --> 00:49:54.950
and our family name
will be forgotten.

00:49:55.033 --> 00:49:57.577
- Whatever happens,

00:49:57.661 --> 00:49:59.246
I know that Adonai
has set me apart

00:49:59.329 --> 00:50:00.000
for a reason
I do not yet know.
